# PumpkinBox

This project is an game platform that allows users to connect to, chat with, and play with their friends online in real time.
The application, login/signup server, chat server, multiplayer games, and client GUI were all built using Java.

It uses TCP and JDBC to connect to an SQL database, and uses JavaFX for the GUI. It also has TicTacToe and Checkers as playable games (which you can play locally against an AI or online against another player).

This project was for the computer networks course I took at university.
Screenshots of the app running are in the "screenshots" folder.
